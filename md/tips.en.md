# In London during the autumn?

Excellent choice! It actually rains less in autumn than in summer and the
temperature is still moderate. The parks looks beautiful in their autumn
colours. In case of rain, you can always go to one of London's excellent museums
which are often free admittance!

The first week of November there is &quot;Bonfire Night&quot;. A spectacle with
fireworks and (of course) bonfires. If you visit London later in the season you
will experience how Londoners prepare themselves for Christmas.

More information or do you want to join me in search of the Christmas spirit?
