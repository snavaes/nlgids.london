# Spring in London

Spend Easter in London. Discover the city on bicycle it is fun and you
will see a lot in a short time. You can also join a Easter Egg Hunt in one
of the many parks. Spring is the best time to visit London. As soon as
the sun is out everybody will look for a spot in the sun.

Two major sport events are 'the Boat race' (between Oxford and Cambridge)
27 March or the London Marathon 24 April.

Most Museums have late openings on Thursdays or Fridays. But 11-14 May,
Museums open all night. Sunday 8 May is the May Fayre and Puppet festival
in Covent Garden.
