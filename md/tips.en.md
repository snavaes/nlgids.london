# In London this winter?


Take a tour on a bike. It will keep you warm and you will see a lot in a short time.

The cold weather is also a good excuse to visit Londonâ€™s many museums. My favourite? With children the science museum and otherwise the Royal Academy the have the most amazing exhibitions.

In February there are pancake races in London. Pancake day is a feast before lent starts (40 days of fasting where you eat no eggs or fat). The Chinese New Year falls on 28 January in 2017 and will be celebrated in central London on the 29th.
