# Summer in the city

Where to go to cool down? Easy, go to one of the parks, London is greener then most big cities or visit one of the fountains like [Somerset
House](http://www.citytrips4kids.nl/sommerset-house-londen/) or the Diana Memorial Fountain. I love the Rooftop Film Club to watch movies and the sunset at the same time. An amazing view.

The biggest event in summer is of course Wimbledon. No tickets and not looking
for a day in the queue? Not to worry, there are lots of great places to watch tennis, like the roof terrace on One New Change.

Or create your own wind and join me on a [cycle tour](https://nlgids.london/cycling).
