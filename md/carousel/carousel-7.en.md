We've had a wonderful tour through London. First day on foot, the second one on
bikes. Especially our children (9 and 11) really enjoyed the stories. London is
a very busy city, but we can highly recommend doing a cycle tour, even with
children. You'll visit beautiful places, that are off the beaten path.

Do you really want to see and experience, hire [Ans](mailto:ans@nlgids.london) to be your guide!
