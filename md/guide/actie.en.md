<span class="lead">Free morning walk Marylebone (English)</span>

Free Marylebone test walk. Join me for a walk in Marylebone on 12th of May at 10.00. 
I am studying to become a Westminster guide and my final exam is a walk in 
Marylebone. A lovely area that I enjoyed researching. 
Send me an [email](mailto:ans@nlgids.london) if you want to be my guinea pig.
