<span class="lead">When my husband got a job offer in London I said immediatly "let's Go".</span>

What a brilliant opportunity to get to know this city as a Londoner.

With my little daughter I explored the city, visited the parks, playgrounds and museums. I would
love to share my knowledge of London with you. Not boring dates, but interesting stories about the
kings, queens, famous people and also everyday life.

I have a masters degree in Tourism and in the Netherlands I worked as a policy adviser and teacher.
But now I do what I like most about Tourism,: giving people an unforgettable experience.

In London I did several courses and I am a qualified City of London guide. Like every Londoner I
know where to go for a nice “cuppa” or a pint of ale if that is more to your liking and please ask
me where to get a gin or cocktail.
