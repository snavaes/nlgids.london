# TermsÂ and conditions

## Payment
Customers with a reservation will receive a confirmation email. The down payment
is 50% to secure your booking. The rest can be paid in cash at the end of the
tour.

## Booking
Depending on the availability of the guide, it's possible to book last minute.
To avoid disappointment, I suggest an early booking; the earlier the better.

## Cancellation
Cancellation is possible by [email](mailto:ans@nlgids.london) The down payment
will be refunded only if cancelled 7 days prior to the tour. Cancellations later
than that will not be refunded. NLgidsLonden reserves the right to cancel a tour
at all times in the light of circumstance beyond NLgidsLonden's control. If it
is not possible to rescheduled the tour, the down payment will be refunded
immediately

## Safety
Safety is important to me, but each customer is responsible for his or her own
safety at all times.  By agreeing to go on a tour, all customers agree to follow
the safety instructions given by the guide. NLgidsLonden will not be liable for
any accidents.

## Departure times
All All customers need to be there at the agreed time and place as all tours
leave promptly. If you are arriving late for some reason or other, please call
to let me know. If you are more than 15 minutes late, you are not eligible for
a refund.
