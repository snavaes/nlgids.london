# Ans Vaessen


When my husband got a job offer in London I said immediately “Let's Go”.
What a brilliant opportunity to get to know this city as a Londoner.

After moving to London I started exploring the City with my little daughter.
I became more and more interested in the history of London and was amazed by what I discovered.
but interesting stories about the kings, queens, famous people and also
everyday life.

Subsequently, I went on to qualify as a (Dutch) tour guide in
[The City of London](http://www.cityoflondonguides.com/find/ans-vaessen).

I would love to share my knowledge of London with you.
Not boring dates, but interesting stories about kings, queens, famous people
and also everyday life.
