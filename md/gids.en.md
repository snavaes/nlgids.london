# Ans Vaessen

After moving to London I started exploring the City with my little daughter.
I became more and more interested in the history of London and was amazed by
what I discovered.

Subsequently, I went on to qualify as a (Dutch) tour guide in
[The City of London](http://www.cityoflondonguides.com/find/ans-vaessen).
