# Afternoon Tea Bus Tour

<span class="lead">Don't want to walk or cycle?</span>

Why not join me on an Afternoon Tea Bus tour?

We start with a short walk and then continue the tour through West London from
a old-timer Routemaster bus. Meanwhile you are being served thee, pastries,
sandwiches and scones.
